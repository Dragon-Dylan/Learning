The conference began to use PPT to show students' studies and attendance. Through data analysis in recent three years, it can be seen that students' classroom learning is improving as a whole. At the same time, it points out the short board of disciplines and urges students to strengthen the short board learning of vulnerable disciplines. In addition, it provides suggestions on further improving the school style supervision from the aspects of classroom teaching management, attendance inspection system, class committee work, study style construction and so on. The last part is the communication between teachers and students. The teachers answered the confusion of class representatives about teaching management and academic situation one by one, and effectively collected the feedback of students to promote teaching and learning. Our college will further strengthen the construction of study style, form a good study style of civilization, honesty, devotion to learning and application, deeply carry out academic assistance and academic warning, and further improve the quality of talent training.}
